<h1>The Art Hub</h1>

Welcome,

Our concept is to show art from undiscovered artists. The purpose is to gather artists to improve their skills and show in the gallery all their art.

The Art Hub now is starting exposing Shane Byrne arts.

## Ux Structure

As the user opens the home page, have an introduction that leads him to see a prominent picture with a concept of the drawing, when the user hovers the picture it will change, creating curiosity for the other pictures in the website. Lead to the latest pictures and the link gallery for more work. If specific work is required the user go into contact that leads him to a form and ask any questions he might have it.
